# Understanding ds-ai-ml-dl-nn

**Autoencoders** properly in the hierarchy form :

* **Field** → **Machine Learning (ML)**
* **Subfield** → **Deep Learning (DL)** (because they use neural networks with multiple layers)
* **Category** → **Unsupervised Learning** (since they learn patterns from data without labels)
* **Technique** → **Representation Learning / Dimensionality Reduction** (they learn compressed, meaningful features from data)

> Autoencoders are a **deep learning technique under unsupervised learning** that aim to **compress data into a lower-dimensional representation (encoding) and then reconstruct it back (decoding)**. They are mainly used for **feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, noise removal, and generative tasks**.
